      <h2>Toyota MR2</h2>
<p><img alt="Toyota MR2" src="../../files/re-volt/preview/toyotamr2.png" title="ZR's car before severe mutilation" />
This is a high-poly conversion from NFS4, designed to handle like a heavy, electric R/C car with a metal body.</p>
<p><strong><a href="../../files/re-volt/cars/toyotamr2.7z">Download</a></strong> (v18.0526)</p>

<h2>Brickfork</h2>
<p><img alt="A brick with a fork wedged into it" src="../../files/re-volt/preview/brickfork.png" title="It had to be done." />
It was the year 2017 of the Common Era. The invading armada of the fearsome Fidget Spinners took Earth by the storm, devastating everything in their path. However, the valiant and united forces of humanity fought back relentlessly, ultimately triumphant in their pursuit of victory.</p>
<p>Biometal, one of humanity's greatest heroes, scoffed at the invaders as they fled back to the hell from whence they came: "What'z next? A brick with a fork wedged into it?"</p>
<p>And so it was.</p>

<h2>Yamaha YZR500</h2>
<p><img alt="Hairdryer" src="../../files/re-volt/preview/yamahayzr.png" title="Watch a motorcycle fly as I play unfitting music" />
This vehicle has been converted to Re-Volt with the aim of introducing motorcycles to the game. While unrealistically nimble and extremely clumsy with weapons, it has, indeed, achieved its goal.</p>

<h2>Pocket Camper</h2>
<p><img alt="Pocket Camper" src="../../files/re-volt/preview/pcamper.png" title="TAKE YOUR SOCKS OFF AND FEEL THE GRASS" />

<h2>Crytocerox</h2>
<p><img alt="Crytox" src="../../files/re-volt/preview/crytocerox.png" title="Clytoceyx Rex" />
This is a combination between StrixMidnight's Rhino Roadster K2 and Kipy's Kookaburra.</p>
<p>Crytocerox distinguishes itself through its high acceleration and excellent cornering ability, which makes up for its inferior top speed. The car may prove difficult to master, but it can provide a challenge even to Pro cars when handled skillfully.</p>

<h2>Volkswagen Passat</h2>
<p><img alt="VW Passat B6" src="../../files/re-volt/preview/vwpassat.png" title="We had three of those back in my day" />
A high-poly Volkswagen Passat, carefully crafted to appear as a low-poly model.</p>

<h2>Toyota ZR</h2>
<p><img alt="Toyota MR2" src="../../files/re-volt/preview/toyotazr.png" title="A car of silence" />
This is a remodel, remap and repaint of the Toyota MR2. It was created as a gift for zipperrulez.</p>

<h2>Banana Shplit</h2>
<p><img alt="Banana Shplit" src="../../files/re-volt/preview/bananashplit.png" title="Conversion from Worms Armageddon" />
