      <p>An R/C car racing game from 1999. The catalyst of my favourite online community. I did some stuff for it.</p>
<h2>The New Are (of Shit)</h2>
<p>After the creation of the <a href="https://re-volt.io/discord">Discord server</a> in 2016, my wonderful friend and abominable snowman, <a href="https://yethiel.github.io/">Marv</a>, went on to create what would later become <a href="http://re-volt.io/">Re-Volt I/O</a>. While he dealt with the groundwork and all, you know, the important stuff, I was busy organising <a href="http://re-volt.io/online">weekly online racing events</a> that are still ongoing to this day. This helped revitalize the community, and I sure as hell am proud of it. It was the most notable thing I did for the community since a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVM-VShGzm8">banana on wheels</a>.</p>
<p>I really didn't do much else aside from that, but Marv's a rather humble guy and insists on <em>not</em> claiming all the credit, so let's pretend I actually contributed something worthwhile to the site itself, aight?</p>
<h2>Custom Content</h2>
<p>Every now and then, I decide to work on mods for the game. Usually, they end up as complete jokes. Can't help it, old habits die hard. Still, I do come up with proper creations every now and then, but I think it's pretty clear at this point that I excel at oversized bananas on wheels and realistic bricks with forks wedged into them.</p>
<p>Check out my <a href="/re-volt/cars/">cars</a> or <a href="/re-volt/tracks/">tracks</a>! Later, though. Still under construction. The fuck are you doing here right now, anyway?</p>
