      <p>I love reading. It's one of my favourite pasttimes. Whenever I pick up a book, I eat that thing up as if it's a serving of curry after two days of hunger. I'm pretty much a pseudo-bookworm at this point. I say pseudo, of course, because I tend to be distracted by a myriad of other forms of entertainment, making it rather rare for me to actually sit down and <em>start</em> reading. I can hear my ancestors shaking their heads vigorously at me.</p>
<p>That said, despite how good I am at reading, I happen to be atrociously bad at writing (leaving aside that it's even more of a rare event). Which is great! Too many good writers out there. I'd just be another sheep in the herd. Why aim for something as overrated as good writing when I can, instead, embrace being good at writing badly?</p>
<p>Still working on that, though. Right now it's just bad. Come to think of it, writing majestically bad is probably an even more difficult goal than writing amazingly good. Can't help it, I'm an ambitious person.</p>
<p>Here's a bunch of stuff that I'm confident they're bad enough to share:</p>
<h2>Short stories</h2>
<p><em>Crickets.</em></p>
<h2>Poetry</h2>
<p><em>Crickets.</em></p>
<h2>Novels</h2>
<p><em>Crickets.</em></p>
